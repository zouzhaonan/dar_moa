Sample codes and results of the TF enrichment analyses (i.e. DEG-MotifEA, DAR-MotifEA, DEG-ChIPEA, and DAR-ChIPEA) used in the manuscript "Elucidating disease-associated mechanisms triggered by pollutants via the epigenetic landscape using large-scale ChIP-Seq data" by Zou et al..

Sample code for performing DAR-ChIPEA on TBT exposure data is provided as ```TBT_example/sh/TBT_dar_chipea.sh```

DAR-ChIPEA can also be easily performed on the websites of ChIP-Atlas (https://chip-atlas.org) following the instructions below.

Procedures of ChIPEA and MotifEA were detailed at the websites of ChIP-Atlas (https://github.com/inutano/chip-atlas/wiki) and the MEME Suite (https://meme-suite.org/meme/), respectively.
